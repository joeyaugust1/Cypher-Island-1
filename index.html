    <h1>Cypher Island – Part One</h1>
    <p>
      You're on a flight to Germany when the plane suddenly hits massive turbulence. Chaos erupts — the lights flicker, passengers scream, and then darkness. 
      By some twist of fate, the plane crash-lands on an unknown island. 
      When you regain consciousness, you're alone, injured, and disoriented — your health is critical (10%). 
      Around you lies scattered debris, torn luggage, and wreckage of the plane... but no other survivors are in sight. 
      You must search the crash site for anything useful — clues, supplies, or answers. 
      Among the wreckage, you uncover a mysterious map of the island, a first aid kit, some spare clothing, and other apparel that may prove valuable later. 
      Once your health is restored with food and rest, you’ll gain the strength to explore. 
      From here, you’ll be able to travel to nearby sub-locations or begin following the main path — a journey full of choices, dangers, and the hope of escape.
