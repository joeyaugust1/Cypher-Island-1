The wreckage is torn apart — no passengers, no bodies. Just silence and ruin. Your body aches, your vision swims, and your health is critical.",

        title: "Beach",
        text: "Stumbling from the crash site, you reach a shoreline drenched in fading sunlight. Waves crash against the sand. The wreckage trail ends here. No footprints. No survivors. The ocean stretches endlessly — no boats, no planes in sight.",

      },
      {
        title: "Cliffs",
        text: "You reach the edge of the beach — sheer cliffs rise before you, black stone slick with sea spray. The way forward is blocked. With no way around, you turn inland toward the dense jungle.",

        title: "River",
        text: "Pushing through tangled undergrowth, you find a flowing river cutting through the island. It offers a moment of relief. You drink and clean your wounds. A current of tension remains — you're being watched. You decide to follow the river upstream.",

      },
      {
        title: "Forest Edge",
        text: "The river leads you into a forest with a canopy so thick it steals the sunlight. Ferns rustle. Something — someone? — was here before. A faint trail branches off from the river path.",

      },
      {
        title: "Mossy Path",
        text: "The narrow path is soft beneath your feet. Strange symbols are carved into nearby stones. You feel an ancient presence watching, but see no one. The path forks — one way lit by fireflies, the other pitch dark.",
        bg: "#364027"
      },
      {
        title: "Shrouded Hollow",
        text: "You choose the firefly path. It leads to a sunken hollow, filled with mist. In the center is a broken compass and a tattered journal. Pages are unreadable, but one shows a drawing of a gate.",

        title: "The Watcher's Tree",

        title: "Stone Altar",

        title: "Gate of Echoes",

        title: "Forgotten Village",
        text: "Inside is a long-abandoned village. Homes built into trees, tools rusting on the ground. You find evidence of a struggle — claw marks, scattered belongings, a diary entry: 'It wakes when the moon is high...'",

        title: "Signal Tower",

      {
        title: "The Howl",
        text: "A low growl rumbles through the trees. Your blood freezes. It's close. You grab a spear from the village and ready yourself. You may not be alone — but you’re still in danger.",
        bg: "#2d2d2d"
      },
      {
        title: "Moonlight Chase",
        text: "The creature emerges — fast, shadowy, and fierce. You run. Trees blur past as you leap roots and dodge branches. A crevice ahead — you jump, tumbling into darkness.",
        bg: "#1a1a1a"
      },
      {
        title: "Underground Chamber",
        text: "You wake in a hidden cavern, safe for now. Symbols line the walls. Your map glows slightly, aligning with the markings. One last route appears — the heart of the island.",

      },
      {
        title: "Heart of the Island",

        title: "The Lift",
